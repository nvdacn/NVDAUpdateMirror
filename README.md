# NVDA Chinese Community Update Mirror

## Introduction

NonVisual Desktop Access ([NVDA]) is a free and open source screen reader for the Microsoft Windows operating system. 

This update mirror source is provided for NVDA Chinese community users. It can enhance the update speed of NVDA, improve the search and download speed of the add-on store, and resolve issues where certain network operators are unable to download add-ons from the add-on store, thus effectively improving user experience.

## Usage
1. Add-on Store Mirror: Users only need to install this add-on, then proceed to normally use the add-on store feature introduced in NVDA-2023.2 for browsing, downloading, and updating add-ons.
2. Update Mirror: Users only need to install this add-on, then follow the regular process to "check for updates" or wait for the software to update automatically. When a new version of NVDA is released, it will detect the update and guide users to download.

## Statement

This mirror source service aims to speed up the download and update speed of NVDA or the add-on store, providing a better user experience for NVDA Chinese users. Rest assured that we will not collect or store any of your information. Your update requests will be sent directly to NV Access for processing.
